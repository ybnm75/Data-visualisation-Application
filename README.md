Heart Disease Classification and Data Visualization App
Overview :
This project involves developing a data visualization application using Tkinter to classify heart disease. 
The model uses the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier trained on two different datasets. 
The Tkinter app allows users to visualize data and display the classification results interactively.

Project Description
The goal of this project is to create an intuitive application that can classify heart disease based on user input and visualize relevant data. The project includes:

Training an MLP classifier on two different heart disease datasets.
Developing a Tkinter-based GUI for data visualization and classification.

Installation and Usage
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/ybn75/heart-disease-visualization-app.git

Run the Tkinter GUI:

appinter2.py

Results
The application provides an interactive way to classify heart disease risk and visualize important data trends. 
The MLP classifier achieves reliable performance, and the visualizations help in understanding the data and model behavior.
